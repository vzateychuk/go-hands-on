Even-Odd calc
---

Task: We will create a program that will read two files at the same time
containing some numbers. You will need to pipe those numbers to a function that will
split them into even and odd based on their values. It will then send the odd numbers to
one routine, even numbers to another. It will then write the addition of all the even and
odd numbers to another file.
